# A user must be able to:
- [X] Start a race timer
- [X] Record the finish time of each runner in that race
- [X] Submit results to a server
- [X] Clear race results from their device after the race

# The mobile app must be able to:
- [X] Record race results on a phone that is in "airplane mode" - i.e. offline
- [X] Store data from one race at a time.
- [X] Provide timing for races up to 24 hours in length
- [ ] Upload race results to a server (either live during the race and/or as a batch upload afterwards if data is recorded in "airplane mode")

# The server should:
- [X] Receive data from users
- [X] Display race results
- [X] Provide timely results (as data is uploaded or immediately after, so runners can see their official positions and times before they go home).

# Extra:
 - [ ] Exporting results to a spreadsheet, possibly using Comma Separated Variable (CSV) format.
 - [ ] Share the race start time so other app users around the course can know when to expect the first runners.
 - [ ] Provide timing screens at checkpoints and at the finish.
 - [ ] Provide a URL for spectators to visit so they can track the face time and finishers.
 - [ ] Provide a capability for marshalls at random checkpoints to record the numbers of runners who pass them,the race-time of the event, and the location of the marshall - this can be useful in longer races to provide rigorous evidence of fair race completion by competitors. 


# Mine
- [ ] Make templates for when a race is running and when it ends
 - [ ] Allow a user to generate a raceID or randomly generate one
 - [ ] Admin view to search though through past races
